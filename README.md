# ConstantFileSorter
Let this run, change the directory to any directory you want and it will operate in the background. Every time you place a file in said directory it will be automatically sorted into a file based off extension. Perfect for your desktop or downloads folder.

If you want a specific directory to be sorted everytime it is used open up the python file with a text editor or notepad++ and simply change the filePath variable to your desired directory.
